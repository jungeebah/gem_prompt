# Gemini Gem Demo Pack (AI+DevOps Advanced)

**Updated:** 2025-08-27

## Files
- `gem_config.yaml` — Paste into your Gem's Instructions/Config.
- `kb.json` — Upload as the Knowledge Base.
- `few_shot.jsonl` — Import/copy exemplars for few-shot.
- `eval_set.jsonl` — Practice queries with expected focus.
- `prompts.md` — Ready-to-use demo prompts.

## Quick Start (5 steps)
1. Create a new Gem in Gemini.
2. Paste contents of `gem_config.yaml` into the Gem's instruction/config area.
3. Upload `kb.json` as a Knowledge Base (use semantic retrieval).
4. (Optional) Load `few_shot.jsonl` exemplars into the Instruction or provide as in-context examples.
5. Use `prompts.md` to run the live demo.

## Tips
- Show retrieval precision first (single-topic), then composition (multi-topic).
- Toggle few-shot exemplars on/off to demonstrate quality changes.
- For context window demos, remove or trim parts of `kb.json` to show degradation.
- When students add entries, refresh the Gem and re-run a query to prove adaptability.

Enjoy your session!

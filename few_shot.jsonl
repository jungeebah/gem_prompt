{"task": "Explain mTLS in microservices", "bad_answer": "mTLS is like regular TLS but faster. Just enable it and everything is secure.", "good_answer": "mTLS authenticates both client and server using X.509 certs. Each side verifies the other's certificate against a trusted CA. Rotate short-lived certs to reduce blast radius; enforce SAN checks; fail-closed on handshake errors; observe with mesh telemetry."}
{"task": "NAT Gateway vs Internet Gateway (IGW) in AWS", "bad_answer": "Both give internet; NAT is cheaper and safer so use it everywhere.", "good_answer": "IGW provides public internet connectivity for resources in public subnets (bidirectional). NAT GW allows instances in private subnets to make egress connections without being publicly reachable. Use IGW + public subnets for ALBs; NAT for private EC2 pulling updates."}
{"task": "Embeddings vs parameters", "bad_answer": "Embeddings are parameters, so there is no difference.", "good_answer": "Embeddings are specific parameter matrices that map tokens/items to vectors; parameters include embeddings plus all trainable weights (attention, MLP layers). Distinguish representation vs total model capacity."}
